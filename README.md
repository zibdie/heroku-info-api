# heroku-info-api

This project was created to utilize the power of GitHub Actions to have an up-to-date list of all information, such as the latest stack, on Heroku.

We can then utilize this to create other CI/CD-powered projects to ensure our repository is always up-to-date to be deployed Heroku and to not worry about our project only working on a deprecated version on Heroku.
