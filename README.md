# heroku-info-api

This project was created to utilize the power of GitHub Actions to have an up-to-date list of all information, such as the latest stack, on Heroku.

We can then utilize this to create other CI/CD-powered projects to ensure our projects are always up-to-date to be deployed Heroku and to not worry about our project using deprecated versions and/or stacks on Heroku.

## How often is this updated?

This repository has a cron job set to run the pipeline every week so you can ensure you will always get the latest Heroku information.

## I'd love if more information was scraped!

No problem, leave a ticket and I will look into it.
